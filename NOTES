 **** This file has some important notes about the decisions and written codes from the development phase of NfQuery. ****

   MySQL INNODB transaction model has autocommit enabled by default. So in database class when we create a database connection instance
   we also set the autocommit disabled. Then we catch the exceptions if any error happens. Finally, we commit the queries into database
   before closing the connection.

   "from multiproccessing import Pool"

   to import Pool or other objects of the multiproccessing module in freebsd, we should have python version of at least 2.7 installed.
   Also there is a warning in multiprocessing documentation:
   "Some of this packages functionality requires a functioning shared semaphore implementation on the host operating system. Without one, 
    the multiprocessing.synchronize module will be disabled, and attempts to import it will result in an ImportError. See issue 3770 for additional information."
