		</br><h3><fieldset><strong>About NfQuery</strong></h3> </br>
		<p>
		<b>NfQuery</b> is NfSen based framework for multi-domain environments which uses the NetFlow data for analysis of threats and burst the usage of already available data from various sources such as on-line repositories and local security tools of each domain (Honeypots, IDS and etc.) The framework is proposed to enable integration of various threat detection methods and transmission of information over a multi-domain environment automatically.	A central server in this framework coordinates the information sharing and integration of various detection methods, where the plug-in running in each domain represents the interface of the system to the administrators for their analysis and information exchange.</p>
		<p>
		The analysis of multi-domain threats definitely requires the collaboration of different domains and exchange of information among these domains. On the other hand, this brings constraints mainly based on privacy imposed by each domain included in the analysis. Therefore the main design criterion lying behind NfQuery is to develop a tool for multi-domain threat analysis which eases the privacy concerns of each domain included in the framework. This is achieved by keeping the NetFlow data belonging to a domain locally and sharing only the queries to be applied over the flow data via the server and the statistics on the results of these queries (which is even optional but quite crucial for the system).</p>
