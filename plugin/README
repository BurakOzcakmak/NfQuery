What is it?
===============
The Plug-in will communicate with Query Server (QS) to fetch new queries or to inform QS about a detected threat. Domains will get the new queries representing the new threats from Query Manager via the Plug-in. These new queries will easily be applied over the aggregated flows of domain with the Plug-in itself.
The second purpose of the communication between the Plug-in and QS is to enable domain to post the data that carries information about a threat occurred in the domain.
